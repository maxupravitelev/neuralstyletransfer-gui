Generate an image in the style of a reference image by utilizing [neural style transfer](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer).

## about
This project provides a frontend GUI for handling a [backend](https://github.com/maxupravitelev/neuralstyletransfer-backend) which is build around handling [Fast Style Transfer for Arbitrary Styles](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization).

This project is also meant to work as a boilerplate for building react applications that communicate with a flask backend handling tensorflow models provided via tensorflow hub.

## demo
You can find a demo of the current stage deployed on [heroku](https://neuralstyletransfer-gui.herokuapp.com/). It might take a little time to wake up the heroku server.


## current stage
This repo is currently in prototype stage.
